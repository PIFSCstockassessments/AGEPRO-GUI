# AGEPRO

AGEPRO (Age Structured Projection Model) is a program designed to evaluate the likely 
population consequences of complex harvest scenarios under alternative hypotheses 
about the stock-recruitment relationship. Uncertainty in initial population size 
at age is incorporated into the model.

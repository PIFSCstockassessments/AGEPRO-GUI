# AGEPRO-GUI

> [!NOTE]
> AGEPRO-GUI version 4.3.6 is compatible with `AGEPRO VERSION 4.0` and `AGEPRO VERSION 4.25` formatted input files.
>
> To use the new **AuxiliaryOutputFlag** Option (_No Stock Of Age AND Auxiliary File_, _Output Stock Of Age, but NO Auxiliary Files_, or _Output Stock Of Age and Auxiliary Files EXCEPT Stock Numbers Of Age Auxiliary File_), Agepro models must be saved under the `AGEPRO VERSION 4.25` input file format to be launched on the AGEPRO calculation engine

This is a Windows-based Graphical interface of [AGEPRO (Age Structured Projection Model)](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/noaa-fit/AGEPRO), designed to evaluate the likely population consequences of complex harvest scenarios under alternative hypotheses about the stock-recruitment relationship. Uncertainty in initial population size at age is incorporated into the model. This GUI is a revamp of the the original NOAA Fisheries National Fisheries Toolbox interface designed by Alan Seaver. 

AGEPRO-GUI includes AGEPRO Calculation Engine, the command line based version of AGEPRO. 

The AGEPRO Calculation Engine source code repository can be found here: [AGEPRO (Calculation Engine Source Code Repo)](https://github.com/noaa-pifsc/AGEPRO).

AGEPRO (Age Structured Projection Model) is a program designed to evaluate the likely population consequences of complex harvest scenarios under alternative hypotheses about the stock-recruitment relationship. Uncertainty in initial population size at age is incorporated into the model.

AGEPRO Version 4.3.0 introduces a new interface, written in C#, takes a look on modernizing Alan Seaver's original NOAA Fisheries National Fisheries Toolbox interface.

# AGEPRO

This is a Windows-based Grahical interface of [AGEPRO (Age Structured Projection Model)](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/noaa-fit/AGEPRO), designed to evaluate the likely population consequences of complex harvest scenarios under alternative hypotheses about the stock-recruitment relationship. Uncertainty in initial population size at age is incorporated into the model. This GUI is a revamp of the the original NOAA Fisheries National Fisheries Toolbox interface designed by Alan Seaver. 

To run AGEPRO models using the original command line based version of AGEPRO, the Calculation Engine source code repository can be found here: [AGEPRO (Calculation Engine Source Code Repo)](https://github.com/PIFSCstockassessments/AGEPRO).

> [!NOTE]
> AGEPRO-GUI is compatable with `AGEPRO VERSION 4.0` and `AGEPRO VERSION 4.25` Input file format.

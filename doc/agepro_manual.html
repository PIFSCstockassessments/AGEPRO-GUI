<h1 id="using-nft-data-grids">Using NFT Data Grids</h1>
<p>NOAA Fisheries Toolbox data grids have many functions that are similar to spreadsheet software programs. However, there are a few differences and limitations. The following topics will describe in detail how to perform common tasks.</p>
<p>Right-clicking on the cell to show the Cut, Copy, Paste and Delete options.</p>
<h3 id="selecting-cells">Selecting Cells</h3>
<p>To select a single cell: Click the cell, or press one of the Arrow keys to move to the cell.</p>
<p>To select more than one cell: Click the on the cell, and while holding the mouse button drag the pointer to the cell in the range of cells you are interested in.</p>
<p>To select an entire row, click on the row heading.</p>
<p>To select the entire grid, do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-Click on the grid and select Select All from the context menu.</li>
<li>Press CTRL+A.</li>
<li>Click the top left grid cell.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="edit-cell-contents">Edit Cell Contents</h3>
<p>You can edit the contents of a cell directly in the cell.</p>
<p>To place the contents of a cell in editing mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click the cell that contains the data that you want to edit. Note that the cursor will be at the end of the cell's contents.</li>
<li>Click the cell that contains the data that you want to edit, and then start typing. If the cell contained any data it will be erased when you start typing.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the cell is still in edit mode, use <strong>Esc</strong> key to cancel the edit. It will revert to previous value before it was entered.</p>
<p>To commit the edits to the cell:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hit the <strong>Enter</strong> key to commit the changes and move the cell selection one cell below.</li>
<li>Hit the <strong>Up</strong> Arrow key to commit the changes and move the cell selection one cell above.</li>
<li>Hit the <strong>Down</strong> Arrow key to commit the changes and move to the cell selection one cell below.</li>
<li>If you are at the last character, hitting the <strong>Right</strong> Arrow key will commit the edit and move the cell selection one cell to the right.</li>
<li>If you are at the first character, hit the <strong>Left</strong> Arrow key will commit the edit and move the cell selection one cell to the left.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="copy-grid-data">Copy Grid Data</h3>
<p>Select a cell or range of cells. Either <strong>Right-Click</strong> on the grid and select Copy from the context menu, or use <strong>CTRL+C</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="paste-grid-data">Paste Grid Data</h3>
<p>If you want to paste data from a spreadsheet program, select and copy the range of cells within the spreadsheet program. The copied cells will be stored to the clipboard. You can also paste data from a text file. Data in a text file should be tab-delimited, rows are line-delimited.</p>
<p>To select where you want the data to be pasted, do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have just one cell of data to paste, click on the cell where you want the data to go.</li>
<li>If you have more than one cell of data to paste, click on the cell you want to be the topmost and leftmost cell of the pasted data. Pasted data will automatically be filled in to the right of and below the cell you select.</li>
</ul>
<p>To paste the data, either <strong>Right-Click</strong> on the grid and select Copy from the context menu, or use <strong>CTRL+V</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="cut-grid-data">Cut Grid Data</h3>
<p>Select a cell or range of cells. Either <strong>Right-Click</strong> on the grid and select Cut from the context menu, or use <strong>CTRL+X</strong>.</p>
<p>The selected cells will be cleared and will be sent to the Windows clipboard.</p>
<h3 id="delete-grid-data">Delete Grid Data</h3>
<p>The Delete function clears all data in the selected cells. Unlike Cut, It does <em>not</em> copy the grid cells to the Windows clipboard.</p>
<p>Select a cell or range of cells. Either <strong>Right-Click</strong> on the grid and select Delete from the context menu, or use the <strong>Delete</strong> key.</p>
<h3 id="fill-data-in-grid-cells">Fill Data in Grid Cells</h3>
<p>Select Fill Blank Cells from the context menu. This will populate any blanks cell from the data grid with “0”.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="stochastic-data-files">Stochastic Data Files</h1>
<p>AGEPRO allows the user to supply stochastic data at age. In addition, the data at age may also vary through the projection time horizon and vary by fleet where applicable.</p>
<p>The user may create a file with stochastic data at age using R or any statistical tool of choice.</p>
<h1 id="stochastic-data-file-format-layout">Stochastic data file format layout</h1>
<p>In order to create a succesful Stochastic Data File, please follow the following data file layout.</p>
<p>The data categories for which this option applies are:</p>
<ul>
<li>JAN-1 Stock Weights</li>
<li>Mid-Year Stock Weights</li>
<li>Spawning Stock Weights</li>
<li>Catch Weights</li>
<li>Discards Weights</li>
<li>Natural Mortality</li>
<li>Fishery Selectivity</li>
<li>Discard Fraction</li>
</ul>
<p>The Stochastic data files are ASCII data files with <strong>space delimited double precision real data</strong>.</p>
<p>For each stochastic observed value, the data consists of a number of <strong>space delimited data items</strong> on each line of the file. Each line is terminated by newline character (a carriage return or carriage return-line feed combination).</p>
<p>In AGEPRO, the user specifies the number of bootstrap iterations on the <strong>Bootstrap</strong> panel. The user also specifies the number of simulations on the <strong>General Options</strong> panel.</p>
<p>The Number of Observed Values is equal to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Number of Bootstraps x Number of Simulations</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="time-variance">Time variance</h2>
<p>If the user has specified that the data is <em><strong>not time varying</strong></em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Number of Data Lines = Number of Observed Values</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Number of Data Columns = Number of Age Classes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, if the user has specified that the data is <em><strong>time varying</strong></em>, then the data layout is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Number of Data Lines = Number of Observed Values x Number of Years</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Number of Data Columns = Number of Age Classes</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="example-1">Example 1:</h3>
<pre><code>Number of Age Classes = 9
Number of Bootstrap Iterations = 1000
Number of Simulations on each Bootstrap iteration = 100
Not Time Variant</code></pre>
<p>The data file for the above input would consist of 100,000 lines of data each with <strong>9</strong> space delimited data values. For each observed value, a single line of data is read in and used in all years in the time horizon.</p>
<h3 id="example-2">Example 2:</h3>
<pre><code>Number of Age Classes = 9
Number of Bootstrap Iterations = 1000
Number of Simulations on each Bootstrap iteration = 100
Number of Years in Projection Horizon = 10
Time Variant</code></pre>
<p>The data file for the above input would consist of 1,000,000 lines of data each with <strong>9</strong> space delimited data values. For each of 100,000 observed values the data is read in for all 10 years.</p>
<h2 id="stochastic-data-file-format-layout-with-multi-fleets">Stochastic data file format layout with multi-fleets</h2>
<p>The following considerations apply to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Catch Weights</li>
<li>Discard Weights</li>
<li>Fishery Selectivity</li>
<li>Discard Fraction</li>
</ul>
<p>If the user has specified more than one fleet, then the data layout differs only in the number of data columns:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Number of Data Columns = Number of Age Classes x Number of Fleets</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On each line the program reads the values at age for the first fleet followed by the values at age for the second fleet, etc.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="specifying-weights-of-age">Specifying Weights of Age</h1>
<p>AGEPRO allows users to input stochastic weights at age.</p>
<p>From the navigation panel, expand the <strong>Weights if Age</strong> node to set the following stochastic weights of age:</p>
<ul>
<li>JAN-1</li>
<li>SSB</li>
<li>Mid-Year (Mean)</li>
<li>Catch</li>
<li>Discard</li>
</ul>
<p>If <em>Discards are present</em> in <strong>General Options</strong> was unchecked or disabled, controls from <em>Discard</em> will be disabled.</p>
<h2 id="jan-1-stock-weights-at-age">JAN-1 Stock Weights at Age</h2>
<p>On the JAN-1 Weights panel, the user can select a data preference:</p>
<ul>
<li>User Specfied Weights of Age</li>
<li>Read Weights from File</li>
</ul>
<p>The user may select to input mean weights at age and apply log-normal error on each observed value, or to read in <a href="#stochastic-data-files">stochastic data from a file</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the user specifies whether the data supplied by either method will be supplied for each year in the time horizon as <em>time varying</em>. Otherwise, the data or to use a single set of weights at age for all years.</p>
<h3 id="example-time-varying">Example: Time Varying</h3>
<p><img src="img/jan1WeightAge_01.png" title="JAN-1 Time Varying" alt="JAN-1 Time Varying" /></p>
<p>In this first example, <em>Time Varying</em> is enabled. The user supplies mean weights at age for each year in the time horizon. In addition, the user also specifies a coefficient of variation for each age.</p>
<p>Log-Normal error with bias correction will be calculated and applied on each observed value for each year in the time horizon</p>
<h3 id="example-non-time-varying">Example: Non Time Varying</h3>
<p><img src="img/jan1WeightAge_02.png" title="JAN-1 Non Time-Varying" alt="JAN-1 Non Time-Varying" /></p>
<p>In the next example, <em>Time Varying</em> is not enabled. The user will supply a single vector of mean values for weights at age. The program will apply error on to he data supplied as above, but the data with error will not vary through the time horizon.</p>
<h3 id="example-from-file-option">Example: From File Option</h3>
<p><img src="img/jan1WeightAge_03a.png" title="JAN-1 Read Weights From File" alt="JAN-1 Read Weights From File" /></p>
<p>In this example, the user has selected to supply <a href="#stochastic-data-files">data from an external file</a> with data for each observed value. Use the browse button to bring up a Windows File Dialog from which the user may select the source data file. No further input is required.</p>

<h1 id="bootstrap">Bootstrap</h1>
<p>Bootstrapping input and options is located on the <strong>Bootstrapping</strong> panel.</p>
<p>The user must input the <strong>Number of Bootstrap iterations</strong>. Each line in the Bootstrap file represents a bootstrap iteration, consisting of space delimited stock values at age as double precision numeric values. The number of data values on each row line must be equal to the number of age classes.</p>
<p>The number of rows in the bootstrap file must be at least equal to the <strong>number of bootstrap iterations</strong>. Since it contains the population of the first year in the projection.</p>
<p>AGEPRO, will ignore additional iterations or bootstrap data intended for addtional projection years.</p>
<p>For each bootstrap iteration the stock values at age in the file will be multiplied by the <strong>Population Scaling Factor</strong>. For example, a population scale factor of <code>1000</code> means that a bootstrap file contains stock values at age equal to thousands of fish.</p>
<p>AGEPRO versions 3.4 and later do not support recruitment ages beyond age 1, therefore the second bootstrap file with Bootstrap F's in earlier versions is no longer used.</p>
<h3 id="scaling-factors-with-vpavirtual-population-analysis">Scaling factors with VPA(Virtual Population Analysis)</h3>
<p>Typically, bootstrap files are generated by the <strong>VPA(Virtual Population Analysis)</strong> or <strong>ASAP(Age Structured Assessment Program)</strong> Models. It is imperative that the user be consistent between VPA or ASAP runs and AGEPRO.</p>
<p>In the following example, the <strong>VPA program input</strong> generates a bootstrap population file which uses a scaling factor of <code>1</code>. Thus, if this were the <strong>VPA</strong> file used to create for <strong>AGEPRO</strong> input, with AGEPRO's <strong>Population Scaling Factor</strong> of <code>1000</code>, then it will imply that the <strong>VPA Catch data</strong> was in <strong>thousands</strong> of fish.<br />

<h1 id="recruitment">Recruitment</h1>
<p>AGEPRO supports multiple recruitment methods. The number of recruitment methods can be specified in the <strong>General Options</strong> panel.</p>
<p>Under <strong>Select Recruitment Models</strong> is a DataGrid object with combo box(es). The number of recruitment methods determines the number of combobox selections.</p>
<p>The combobox will be populated with the following models:</p>
<ul>
<li>Model 1: Markov Matrix</li>
<li>Model 2: Empirical Recruits per Spawning Biomass Distribution</li>
<li>Model 3: Empirical Recruitment Distribution</li>
<li>Model 4: Two-Stage Empirical Recruits per Spawning Biomass Distribution</li>

<li>Model 20: Fixed Recruitment</li>
<li>Model 21: Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function of Recruitment w/ Linear Decline to Zero</li>
</ul>
<p>The user can choose multiple instances of a Recruitment Model (example: All 3 Recruitment Models can be a Beverton-Holt Curve Model). <strong>However, Only a single instance of the Markov Matrix model is allowed.</strong></p>
<p>Note: Model 9: Time-Varying Empirical Recruitment Distribution is not supported in AGEPRO version 4.0 and later. This model can be reimplemented by specifying multiple instances of Model 3.</p>
<h2 id="recruitment-probability">Recruitment Probability</h2>
<p>Each model selection is given a probability in each year of the projection time horizon. In each realization, and each year in the projection time horizon, a single recruitment method is randomly selected from a multinomial distribution.</p>
<p>For each year (row), the Recruitment Probably selections (columns) must sum up to 1.0.</p>
<h2 id="specifying-scaling-factors-for-recruitment-and-ssb">Specifying Scaling Factors for Recruitment and SSB</h2>
<p><strong>Recruitment Scaling Factor</strong> and <strong>SSB Scaling Factor</strong> are explicit scaling factors that is applied to recruitment models. The calculated recruitment from the model will be <em>multiplied by the Recruitment Scaling Factor</em> before it is outputted to the user. The calculated Spawning Stock Biomass will be <em>divided by the SSB Scaling Factor</em> for use within recruitment model calculations.</p>
<p>Recruitment Scaling Factor scales in number of fish (for recruit values in Recruitment Model parameters). SSB Scaling Factor scales in Metric Tons (for SSB/biomass values in Recruitment Model parameters).</p>
<h2 id="specifying-the-first-recruitment-age-class">Specifying the First Recruitment Age class</h2>
<p>The user has the option to select either <strong>Age 0</strong> or <strong>Age 1</strong> as the first recruitment age class in General options panel. The default is <strong>Age 1</strong> recruitment.</p>
<p>For <strong>Age 1 Recruitment</strong>, the calculated recruitment is introduced into the first Age Class in the subsequent year.</p>
<p>In those methods in which Recruitment is a function of Spawning <strong>Stock Biomass, the stock numbers in the first Age class in Year T+1 will be equal to the predicted recruitment based on SSB in Year T</strong>.</p>
<p>If <strong>Age 0 Recruitment</strong> is selected, the calculated recruitment is introduced into the first Age Class in the current year for all years except the first year in the time horizon.</p>
<p>For those recruitment methods in which Recruitment is a function of Spawning Stock Biomass, the <strong>stock numbers for Age 0 in Year T will be equal to The predicted recruitment based on SSB in the same Year.</strong> This rule applies to all years <strong>except the first year</strong> in the time horizon.</p>
<p>AGEPRO does not support first recruitment ages classes beyond 1. </p>

<h1 id="harvest-scenario">Harvest Scenario</h1>
<p>The <strong>Harvest Scenario</strong> panel includes a data grid used to determine the level of population harvest for each year in the projection horizon.</p>
<p>In addition, the user may use this data grid for additional harvest calculations such as the <strong>P-Star Analysis</strong>, or Stock <strong>Rebuilder Target</strong>. By default, <strong>None (only Harvest Scenario)</strong> is selected.</p>
<h2 id="harvest-scenario-table">Harvest Scenario Table</h2>
<p>In the Harvest Scenario data grid table, the user must specify the <em>Harvest Specfication</em> for each year in the projection time horizon. The choices are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Landings (MT)</li>
<li>Removals (Landings and Discards) (MT)</li>
<li>Total Fishing Mortality or &quot;F-MULT&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>For single fleet models, apply the <em>Harvrest Specfication</em> values under the <em>HARVEST VALUE</em> column. For multiple fleet models, input the values for the intended fleet (e.g. <em>F-MULT</em> specfic values for <em>FLEET-2</em>). In either case, harvest specification values must be <em>numeric</em>.</p>
<h2 id="rebuilder-target-option">Rebuilder Target Option</h2>
<p>AGEPRO allows an option for the user to specify a Rebuilder target and calculate the Fishing Mortality level required to meet this target to a specified confidence level.</p>

<h1 id="agepro-model-job-run">AGEPRO Model Job Run</h1>
<p>Launching an AGEPRO model marks a new <strong>AGEPRO Model Job Run</strong>.</p>
<p>When the <strong>Launch AGEPRO model</strong> menu option is selected. AGEPRO will check if the form inputs are valid. If valid, it will grab a copy of the bootstrap file, and stores the GUI input under a desginagted <strong>AGEPRO model job run directory</strong> under the <code>AGEPRO</code> subdirectory, under the desginagted user document directory (<code>documents</code> or <code>My Documents</code>). The <code>AGEPRO</code> subdirectory will be created if it didn't exist under the document directory.</p>
<p>The <strong>AGEPRO model job run directory</strong> may be entitled two ways. It may take base name given in input file from general options (without file extensions)<br />
appended with a date-time stamp when the model was launched. If input file in general options is blank, then it will generate a random filename (without file extensions) and the date-time stamp this model launched.</p>
<p>Output files generated by the calcuation engine run will be stored at its <strong>AGEPRO model job run directory</strong>.</p>
<p>After the calcuation engine is finished, AGEPRO will open a new window showing the directory the outputs were written to.</p>

<h2 id="auxiliary-output-files">Auxiliary Output Files</h2>
<p>AGEPRO includes a set of enhanced auxiliary output files. These files will be saved in their desginagted <strong>AGEPRO Model Job run directory</strong>.</p>
<p>The Auxiliary files follow the naming conventions that are used to make the AGEPRO model job run directory, but have different file extensions.</p>
<p>All auxiliary file data items are space delimited double precision real numbers in scientific notation.</p>
<p>In the following auxiliary files the number of columns is equal to the number of years in the time horizon and the number of rows is equal to the number of observed values. These files are created in all cases.</p>
<p>The number of observed values is equal to the number of bootstrap iterations multiplied by the number of simulations.</p>
<p>The <strong>units used in the auxiliary files are not affected by the <a href="#/scaling-option-in-output-report">summary report scaling factors</a></strong> optionally applied to the report file.</p>

<h2 id="summary-report-of-stock-numbers-of-age">Summary Report of Stock Numbers of Age</h2>
<p>To request an summry report, check the option <strong>Ouput Summary Report for Stock Numbers at Age</strong>. When enabled, the program will generate a table of stock number distribution at age for each year in the time horizon.</p>
<p>Generating a summary report with a large time horizon and/or large number of age classes is not recommended, since it can affect completeion of the AGEPRO model run.</p>
<h2 id="export-to-r">Export to R</h2>
<p>If <strong>Export Results to R</strong> is enabled, a file will be created in the same directory as the input file, with a name based on the name of the input file except with an <code>.RDAT</code> extension. The data in the file is stored in the the R &quot;ddump&quot; format, which is an ASCII representation of an R object.</p>
<p>Data in this format can be read into R using a single &quot;dget&quot; command. In R, you would type something like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">x =<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">dget</span>(<span class="st">&#39;myfile.rdat&#39;</span>)</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="specifying-a-specfic-percentile-in-output-report">Specifying a Specfic Percentile in Output Report</h2>
<p>The <a href="#summary-report-of-stock-numbers-of-age">Summary Report</a> provides tables of the distribution of calculated results at standard distribution intervals including the median. However, a summary report with a specfic percentile that is not equal to the standard distribution internal can be requested.</p>
<p>To create the Percentile Report in the Output File, check the <strong>Reqest Percentile Report</strong> checkbox option in <em>Output Options</em> Section in the <strong>Misc. Options</strong> panel. Then, enter a percentile value between <code>0.0</code> and <code>100.0</code> in the <strong>Report Percentile</strong> spinbox.</p>
<p>The <a href="#/scaling-option-in-output-report">summary report scaling units</a> are the same as were are used in the output report with a standard distribution.</p>
